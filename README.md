    You can use just enter in the crate directory and run nix-shell .
    This will do all the requirements and other stuff and run the system in the current nix shell
```

# PROCEDURE 2 (DOCKER)

```
    Just do docker compose up -d in the crate directory
    This will do all the things required
```
