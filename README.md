## HOW TO SETUP THE SYSTEM (3 ways)

### PROCEDURE 1 (FOR NIX USERS LIKE ME)

```
1. I have a nix shell file setup already
2. Enter the crate directory and run nix-shell
3. This will fetch all the requirements and run the system in the current nix shell
```

### PROCEDURE 2 (DOCKER)

```
1. Just do docker compose up -d in the crate directory
2. This will do all the required things
```

### PROCEDURE 3 (NATIVE WAY)
